Intro Task (Assessment): 10 Questions in Increasing Difficulty

This assessment checks whether you can operate in a Linux environment the way a robotics operator must: navigate safely, inspect files and logs, reason about permissions, find processes, and diagnose basic system/network states. Answer in your own words where asked. For command questions, write the exact command(s).

Question 1 (very easy)
What is the difference between a terminal and a shell, and what is bash?

Question 2 (very easy)
Explain what Ubuntu LTS means and why robotics teams prefer LTS releases.

Question 3 (easy)
You are in an unknown directory and need to know where you are and what files exist there. Which two commands do you run?

Question 4 (easy)
You want to create this workspace structure in your home folder: ~/robotics/scripts and ~/robotics/logs. What single command creates both directories even if ~/robotics does not exist?

Question 5 (medium)
Explain what the redirection “2>/dev/null” does in simple terms, and give one realistic example of why you would use it when searching logs.

Question 6 (medium)
You have a log file called robot.log and want to see the last 50 lines. Which command do you run? Then, which command would you use to follow the log live as it grows?

Question 7 (medium-hard)
You run a script and get “Permission denied”. The file exists. What is the most likely fix, and which command applies it? Explain what changed.

Question 8 (hard)
A process named “robot_node” is stuck. You want to find its PID and stop it gracefully first, and only force-kill if needed. Which sequence of commands do you use?

Question 9 (hard)
You suspect the disk is full and that is breaking the robot software. Which two commands do you run to confirm disk usage and identify which folder is consuming space?

Question 10 (hardest)
A robot application is running as a systemd service instance called robot-app@robotop. The service fails to start. Which two commands do you run to (1) see the status and (2) see the last 100 log lines for that service? Also state one common reason this service might be “not found”.

End of task.
